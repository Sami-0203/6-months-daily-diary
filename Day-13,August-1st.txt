Introduction to bootstrap and liberary(Frameworks and its various functions)

Bootstrap is a powerful, open-source CSS framework designed for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It was originally developed by Twitter and is now widely used due to its ease of use and flexibility. Bootstrap provides pre-designed components, responsive grid systems, and utilities that allow developers to create modern, visually appealing web pages with minimal custom CSS.

What is a Library?
A library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to perform common programming tasks without having to write code from scratch. Libraries are typically designed to be modular, allowing developers to call specific functions as needed.


What is a Framework?
A framework is a structured platform for developing software applications. It provides a foundation, including predefined classes, functions, and tools, that enforce certain design patterns or workflows. Frameworks often have a "convention over configuration" approach and control the flow of the application.
