Grid system in bootstrap

The grid system in Bootstrap is a powerful layout tool that helps you create responsive and consistent designs by dividing the page into a flexible grid structure. Here’s an overview:

Key Features of the Bootstrap Grid System:

1.12-Column Layout:
The grid system is based on a 12-column structure. You can combine columns to create wider columns by spanning multiple grid columns.

2.Responsive Design:
The grid adjusts according to the screen size, ensuring your layout looks great on all devices.
It uses media queries to target different device sizes.

3.Breakpoints:
Predefined screen size ranges:
xs (extra small, <576px)
sm (small, ≥576px)
md (medium, ≥768px)
lg (large, ≥992px)
xl (extra large, ≥1200px)
xxl (extra-extra large, ≥1400px)

4.Classes:
container or container-fluid: Defines the grid container.
row: Creates a horizontal group of columns.
col or col-{breakpoint}-{size}: Defines a grid column.

How the Grid System Works:

1.Containers:
Containers provide a wrapper for the grid and content.

2.Rows:
Rows are horizontal groups of columns.
Use .row to create a new row.

3.Columns:
Use .col or .col-{breakpoint}-{size} to define columns.

4.Responsive Columns:
Define different column sizes for different breakpoints.
