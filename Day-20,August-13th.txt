What are operators and different types of operators.

In JavaScript, operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values or variables. They manipulate data and return a result.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of different types of operators in JavaScript:

1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for mathematical calculations.
Example:
+,-,*,%,++(increment add 1),--(decrement subtract 1).

2.Assignment Operator
Used to assign values to variables.
Example:
=(Assignment),+=(Add and assign),-=(Subtract and assign),*=(Multiply and assign),/=(Divide and assign),%=(Modulus and assign).

3.Logical Operators
Used for logical operations, often with Boolean values.
Example:
&&(Logical AND),`(Logical OR),!(Logical NOT).

4. Bitwise Operators
Operate at the bit level.
Example:
&(AND),	`(OR),^(XOR),~(NOT),<<(Left shift),>>(Right shift).

5.String Operators
Operate on strings.
Example:
+(Concatenation),+=(Add and assign concatenation)

6.Ternary Operator
A shorthand for conditional expressions.
Example:
condition ? value1 : value2	5 > 3 ? "Yes" : "No"	"Yes"
