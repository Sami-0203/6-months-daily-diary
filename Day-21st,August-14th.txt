1. else Statement
The else statement is used to define a block of code that runs when a condition in an if statement is not true.

Syntax:
if condition:
    # Code block if the condition is True
else:
    # Code block if the condition is False

Example:
x = 5
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is 10 or less")

2.if-else Statement
Combines an if condition and an else block to execute one of two possible blocks of code.

Syntax:
if condition:
    # Code block if the condition is True
else:
    # Code block if the condition is False

Example:
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")

3.if-else-if (also called if-elif-else)
Used for testing multiple conditions. Each condition is checked in sequence, and the first condition that evaluates to True executes its block of code.

Syntax:
if condition1:
    # Code block for condition1
elif condition2:
    # Code block for condition2
elif condition3:
    # Code block for condition3
else:
    # Code block if none of the conditions are True

Example:
marks = 85
if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 50:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
4. Nested Conditional Statements
Conditions inside other conditions to create more specific checks.

Syntax:
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        # Code block for condition1 and condition2
    else:
        # Code block for condition1 and not condition2
else:
    # Code block if condition1 is False
Example:
age = 20
gender = "Male"

if age >= 18:
    if gender == "Male":
        print("You are an adult male.")
    else:
        print("You are an adult female.")
else:
    print("You are not an adult.")
5. Switch Statement
Python does not have a built-in switch statement, but similar functionality can be achieved using a dictionary to map cases to actions.
Example (Using Dictionary):

def switch_example(value):
    switch = {
        1: "Case 1",
        2: "Case 2",
        3: "Case 3",
    }
    return switch.get(value, "Default case")

print(switch_example(1))  # Outputs: Case 1
print(switch_example(4))  # Outputs: Default case
Example (Using match-case):

value = 2

match value:
    case 1:
        print("Case 1")
    case 2:
        print("Case 2")
    case 3:
        print("Case 3")
    case _:
        print("Default case")
And we have done question related to it
