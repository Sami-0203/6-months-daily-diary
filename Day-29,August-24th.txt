How to create a digital clock, classelementID, Text content property.

Creating a digital clock in JavaScript can be done by updating the text content of an HTML element every second. You can use the setInterval() function to run a function periodically, and the Date object to get the current time. Here's how you can build a simple digital clock:

Step-by-Step Digital Clock Example
1.Create an HTML element that will display the clock.
2.Use JavaScript to get the current time.
3.Update the content of the HTML element using the textContent property.
4Use setInterval() to update the clock every second.

HTML & JavaScript Example:

HTML Structure:

A <div> element with an id="clock" is created. This is where the time will be displayed.

JavaScript:
The updateClock() function is defined to get the current time using the Date object.
The getHours(), getMinutes(), and getSeconds() methods are used to extract the hours, minutes, and seconds.
Leading zeros are added to the time components (e.g., 09 for hours or minutes) if they are less than 10.
The time is then formatted as a string (HH:MM:SS) and assigned to the textContent of the clock element using document.getElementById("clock").textContent = timeString;.
The setInterval() function is used to call the updateClock() function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second), so the clock updates in real-time.

CSS Styling:
Basic styling is applied to the clock element to make it visually appealing (e.g., large font size and center alignment).

Key Concepts Used:
getElementById(): This method is used to find the HTML element with the ID clock.
textContent: This property sets or returns the text content of an element. In this case, it updates the clock's displayed time.
setInterval(): This method repeatedly executes a function every specified number of milliseconds. Here, it's used to update the clock every second.

Result:
When you open the HTML file in a browser, you'll see a digital clock that updates every second. The time will be displayed in the format HH:MM:SS.
