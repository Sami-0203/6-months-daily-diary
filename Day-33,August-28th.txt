AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
AJAX is a technique for creating asynchronous web applications. It allows you to update parts of a web page without reloading the entire page.

Key Methods of AJAX
AJAX is often implemented using the XMLHttpRequest object or the modern fetch API.

XMLHttpRequest Methods

open(method, URL, async)
Specifies the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) and URL.

send(data)
Sends the request to the server.

setRequestHeader(header, value)
Sets custom headers like Content-Type.

abort()
Cancels an ongoing request.

HTTP Methods in AJAX

GET: Retrieve data from the server.
POST: Send data to the server for processing.
PUT: Update data on the server.
DELETE: Delete data from the server.

CRUD Operations with AJAX
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. Here's how it maps to HTTP methods:

CRUD Operations	
Create	-POST(Adds new data).
Read	-GET(Retrieves existing data).
Update	-PUT(Modifies existing data).
Delete	-DELETE(Removes data).
