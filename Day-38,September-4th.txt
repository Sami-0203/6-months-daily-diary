Controlled and Uncontrolled components

In React, controlled and uncontrolled components refer to how form elements (like <input>, <textarea>, <select>, etc.) are handled in terms of state and interaction with the React component. These terms describe two different approaches for managing the data flow within the form elements.

1. Controlled Components
A controlled component is an input element whose value is controlled by the state of the React component. The value of the input is bound to the component's state, and any change in the input value is reflected in the state.

How Controlled Components Work:
Value Prop: The value of the form element (like <input>, <textarea>) is controlled by the state of the component.
onChange Handler: The input's value is updated via an onChange event handler, which updates the state accordingly.

Advantages of Controlled Components:
Single Source of Truth: The state of the input is always stored in React, so the UI is always in sync with the underlying data.
Validation and Filtering: You can easily apply validation, filtering, and transformation logic in the onChange handler or form submission logic.
Easy to manage form state: Controlled components make it easier to manage complex form interactions.

2. Uncontrolled Components
An uncontrolled component is an input element where the value is handled by the DOM itself. React does not control the value of the input, and the input is accessed directly using refs (references).

How Uncontrolled Components Work:
Default Value: The initial value is set using the defaultValue or defaultChecked prop, but React does not track changes to it.
ref Attribute: You use a ref to directly access the DOM node for reading or modifying its value.

Advantages of Uncontrolled Components:
Less Boilerplate: Uncontrolled components can be simpler to implement, especially for forms with minimal interaction or when you don't need to track the input value at all times.
Faster Performance: Since React isn't constantly re-rendering the form on every keystroke, uncontrolled components can have better performance, especially in large forms with many fields.
Simplicity for simple forms: If you don’t need to perform logic on the input fields, using uncontrolled components might be simpler.

When to Use Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components

Use Controlled Components:
When you need to enforce a single source of truth.
When you need to validate, filter, or transform form input before submission.
For complex forms where state management and handling are crucial.
When you want to directly control the input’s value through React state.

Use Uncontrolled Components:
For simple forms or when you don’t need to interact with the form data as the user types.
If you want to optimize for performance in large forms with minimal logic.
When you want to quickly access form data without needing React to manage the state.
