Form Validation in React
Form validation is a critical aspect of handling user input in React applications. It ensures that the data entered by the user is in the correct format and meets the required conditions before it is processed or submitted. React provides a flexible way to implement form validation, either by handling validation logic within the component itself or by using third-party libraries.

Types of Form Validation

1.Client-Side Validation: Performed in the browser, usually with JavaScript or React logic, before sending the data to the server.
2.Server-Side Validation: Performed on the server after the data has been sent, to ensure it meets the requirements.
In React, we generally focus on client-side validation using the component’s state.

Steps to Implement Form Validation in React

Track form input values using React state.
Add validation logic in the event handler (usually the onSubmit or onChange event).
Provide feedback to the user (error messages) based on validation results.

Basic Example of Form Validation in React
we’ll build a simple form with:

A name field that should not be empty.
An email field with a simple regex to validate the format.

1.State Management (formData and errors):
formData: Holds the current values of the form fields.
errors: Holds the error messages for each form field.

2.Form Change Handling (handleChange):
The handleChange function updates the formData state whenever the user types into the form fields.

3.Validation Logic (validate):
The validate function checks whether each field meets its validation requirements. If there’s an issue, it updates the errors state with appropriate messages.
The regex used in the email validation checks if the email format is correct (basic check).

4.Form Submission Handling (handleSubmit):
The handleSubmit function is triggered when the form is submitted. It first runs the validate function. If no errors are found (i.e., the validation passes), the form is submitted. Otherwise, it prevents submission, and the user sees the error messages.

5.Conditional Rendering of Error Messages:
Each field has an error message rendered conditionally based on the value in the errors state. If the field has an error, the error message is displayed below the field in red.
