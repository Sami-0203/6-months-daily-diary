Map to dispatch function and how add functionality to add to cart button
To implement a "map to dispatch function" and add functionality to an "Add to Cart" button in a React + Redux application, we follow these steps:

Step 1: Define Action Types and Action Creators
First, define action types and create action creators for adding items to the cart.

Step 2: Create the Reducer
Create a reducer that updates the state of the cart when the ADD_TO_CART action is dispatched.

Step 3: Set Up the Redux Store
Combine reducers (if necessary) and create the Redux store.

Step 4: Map Dispatch to Props
Use mapDispatchToProps to dispatch the addToCart action when the button is clicked.

Step 5: Display Cart Contents
Create a component to display the items added to the cart.

Step 6: Wrap the Application with the Redux Provider
Wrap your app in the Provider component and pass the store.
