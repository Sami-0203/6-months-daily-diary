Usestate Hook, Useeffect Hook and question based on them

1. useState Hook
The useState hook is used to create and manage state in functional components. It allows you to declare state variables and provides a function to update them.

Syntax
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

state: The current state value.
setState: A function to update the state.
initialValue: The initial value of the state.

2. useEffect Hook
The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It runs after the render, and you can specify dependencies to control when it executes.

Syntax
useEffect(() => {
  
  return () => {
  };
}, [dependencies]);

Callback Function: The code to execute after the render.
Cleanup Function: A function to clean up resources (e.g., clear intervals).
Dependencies Array: Controls when the effect runs. Leave empty [] to run only once
