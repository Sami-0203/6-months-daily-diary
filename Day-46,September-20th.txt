What is REPL?
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop. It is an interactive environment provided by Node.js where:

Read: The user inputs a command.
Eval: The command is evaluated.
Print: The result of the command is displayed.
Loop: The process repeats until the user exits.

Features of REPL:
Interactive:
Execute JavaScript code directly in a terminal.
Test small code snippets quickly.

Real-Time Feedback:
See the results of code execution immediately.

Built-In Commands:
Use .help for a list of commands.
Use .exit to quit the REPL environment.

Advantages of REPL:
Ideal for quick debugging and testing.
Experiment with Node.js APIs.
Learn JavaScript interactively.

Buffer in Node.js

What is a Buffer?
A Buffer is a temporary memory allocation in Node.js used to store binary data.
It is specifically useful because JavaScript (in browsers) does not natively handle raw binary data.

Why Use Buffers?
Binary Data Handling:
Buffers allow Node.js to work with data in streams or files where raw bytes need to be processed.

Fixed Memory Allocation:
Buffers allocate a specific amount of memory, which is useful for operations like file I/O or network requests.

Efficient Data Processing:
Ideal for reading or writing data in chunks, such as streaming video or audio.

How to Create a Buffer:
Using the Buffer class
From an Array
From a String

Buffer Methods:
Write to Buffer.
Convert to String.
Access Individual Bytes.
Buffer Length.
