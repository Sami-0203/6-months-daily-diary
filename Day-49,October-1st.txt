HTTP modules and its method

The http module in Node.js is a core module that allows developers to create HTTP servers and make HTTP requests. It provides tools for both server-side and client-side HTTP communication.

HTTP Module Overview
The http module is commonly used to:

Create an HTTP server.
Handle HTTP requests and responses.
Make HTTP requests to other servers (as a client).
Importing the HTTP Module
const http = require('http');

Creating an HTTP Server

HTTP Methods
HTTP methods are used to define the type of operation a client wants to perform on a resource.

Common HTTP Methods

Method	Description
GET	Retrieve data from the server. Typically used for fetching resources.
POST	Send data to the server to create a new resource.
PUT	Update an existing resource or create one if it doesnâ€™t exist.
DELETE	Delete a resource on the server.

Important Properties and Methods
Request Object (req)
The request object represents the HTTP request and contains properties such as:

Property	Description
req.method	The HTTP method used (e.g., GET, POST).
req.url		The URL of the request.
req.headers	An object containing the headers of the request.
req.on('data')	Event listener to handle incoming data chunks (useful for POST).
req.on('end')	Event fired when the request has finished sending data.

Advanced Features
Handling JSON Data
HTTPS Module: For secure communication, use the https module, which works similarly to http but requires SSL/TLS certificates.
Middleware Integration: While the http module provides basic functionality, libraries like Express simplify complex HTTP server setups with built-in middleware support.
