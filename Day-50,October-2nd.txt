HTTP module,perform routing with http and express

Routing is a key feature in building web applications. It involves defining how an application responds to various HTTP requests at different paths or endpoints. Both the http module and the express framework can be used for routing in Node.js, but express simplifies the process significantly.

Routing with the http Module
The http module provides basic functionality to handle routing, but it requires manual parsing of request URLs and methods.

Basic Routing with http
You must manually check req.url and req.method to determine the route.
You need to handle data (e.g., POST bodies) with event listeners.

Routing with Express
Express is a Node.js framework that simplifies the process of routing and handling HTTP requests.

Setting Up Express
Install Express:
npm install express

When to Use Each
http Module:
Suitable for simple applications with minimal routes.
Useful for learning and understanding low-level server operations.

Express:
Ideal for production applications.
Offers scalability, simplicity, and a large ecosystem of plugins.
