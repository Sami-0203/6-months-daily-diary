Multer Middleware

Multer is a middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for file uploads in Node.js applications. It processes incoming files and appends them to the req.file or req.files object.

Installation
You can install Multer using npm:
npm install multer

How Multer Works?
Multer processes incoming form data and:

1.Parses the files sent via multipart/form-data.
2.Stores the files in a specified location (disk or memory).
3.Attaches metadata and file information to the req object.

Advanced Configuration
1. Multiple Files
To upload multiple files.

2. Multiple Fields
To upload files from different fields.

3. Memory Storage
To store files in memory as Buffer objects instead of saving them to disk.

4. File Filtering
Restrict file uploads by MIME type or other conditions.

5. Set File Size Limits
To limit file size during uploads.

6.Error Handling
Multer uses next() to pass errors, which can be handled using an error-handling middleware
