Create various API's to read,delete,update with the database in mongoose

Creating various APIs to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with MongoDB using Mongoose in a Node.js backend application involves the following steps:

Set up the environment: Install necessary packages like express, mongoose, etc.
Define the model schema.
Create routes to handle different CRUD operations.
Letâ€™s go step by step.

1. Set Up the Environment
Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed.

Initialize a Node.js project:
npm init -y

Install necessary packages:
npm install express mongoose

2. Set Up MongoDB Connection

3. Define the Mongoose Schema and Model
Example: We can define a simple User model with the fields name, age, and city.

4. Create the CRUD APIs
a. Create a User (POST)
b. Get All Users (GET)
c. Get a User by ID (GET)
d. Update a User (PUT)
e. Delete a User (DELETE)

5. Start the Server

// Start the Express server
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
