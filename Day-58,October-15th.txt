Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward way to interact with MongoDB, offering powerful tools for managing your MongoDB schema, data validation, and interactions with your database.

Key Features of Mongoose:
Schema Definition: Mongoose allows you to define the structure of your data using schemas.
Data Validation: You can set validation rules for fields in your schema, such as required fields, minimum/maximum lengths, and custom validation functions.
Middleware (Hooks): Mongoose supports middleware to add logic before or after certain operations (e.g., before saving a document or after deleting it).
Query Building: Mongoose provides a rich API for building queries and working with your database in a more abstract way.
Model Methods: You can define custom methods to operate on the documents.
Population: Mongoose can populate data from other collections automatically (like performing JOIN operations in relational databases).

Setting Up Mongoose
To use Mongoose, follow these steps:

1. Install Mongoose
npm install mongoose

2. Establish a Connection to MongoDB

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

Creating a Schema and Model
A schema defines the structure of the documents in a collection, and a model is a wrapper for interacting with that schema in the database.

1. Defining a Schema
In this, userSchema defines the structure for the User documents in the MongoDB database.

2. Creating a New Document
3. Reading Documents from MongoDB
4. Updating a Document
5. Deleting a Document

Mongoose Middleware (Hooks)
Mongoose allows you to define middleware (or hooks) to run before or after certain operations. For example, you can perform an action before saving or deleting a document.
