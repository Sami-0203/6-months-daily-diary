Create form and connect html file with other and save data in database

To create a form in HTML and save the data to a MongoDB database using Node.js and Mongoose, we'll break down the process into the following steps:

Create an HTML Form to Collect User Data
Set Up a Node.js Backend to Handle Requests
Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose
Save the Form Data to the MongoDB Database
1. Create an HTML Form (Frontend)
Create a simple HTML file with a form that collects user information, such as name, age, and city.
for example, index.html
The form will collect data for the name, age, and city fields.
The form sends a POST request to the /submit endpoint on the server.

2. Set Up Node.js Backend
Now, set up the backend using Express.js to handle the POST request from the form and save the data to MongoDB.

Install Required Packages:
Express: Web framework for Node.js.
Mongoose: MongoDB ODM for easier interaction with the database.
Body-parser: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose body-parser
Backend Code:
Create a new file for the backend server, for example, server.js.

3. Run the Server
After creating the necessary files, run your Node.js server.

Now, open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You will see the HTML form. After filling out the form and submitting it, the data will be sent to the server and saved in the MongoDB database.

5. MongoDB Setup
Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your local machine, or use a MongoDB cloud service like MongoDB .
