CORS Middleware and Fetching Data in Frontend and Backend

1. What is CORS?
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to allow or restrict web applications running at one origin (domain) to make requests to a different origin (domain). By default, browsers block requests from different origins unless the server explicitly allows it.

2. CORS Middleware in Backend (Express)
In a typical scenario, if you're developing a frontend and backend that run on different ports (for example, React on http://localhost:3000 and Node.js backend on http://localhost:5000), you'll need to enable CORS in your backend so that the frontend can communicate with the backend.

Setting up CORS Middleware in Express
To enable CORS in your backend, you can use the cors middleware.

Install CORS Middleware:
First, install the cors package in your Node.js project.
npm install cors

Setting up CORS in the Server (Express)
In your server.js file (or wherever you set up your Express server), you need to import and use the cors middleware.

Backend Routes:
GET /users: Fetches data (list of users) from the database.
POST /submit: Saves form data from the frontend to the database.
3. Fetch Data in Frontend (React)
In the frontend (React), you can use the fetch API to send requests to the backend and handle the response. Here's how to make both GET and POST requests.

Fetch Data (GET request)
In the React app, you can fetch data from the backend (the /users endpoint that returns a list of users) and display it.

Displaying Data: The fetched users are displayed in a list. If no users are found, a message is shown.
Fetch Data (POST request from Form)
In the UserForm component, you can send form data to the backend using a POST request.

4. Run the Application
Start the Backend Server: Make sure your backend is running with the following command:
node server.js
Start the React Frontend: Run the React app in another terminal window:

npm start
Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the React app.

5. Check the Console
Frontend: Open the browser's Developer Tools (press Ctrl+Shift+I), go to the Console tab, and you should see the form data logged from the backend response.
Backend: In your backend terminal, you will see the data being printed when the form is submitted (saved user data).
