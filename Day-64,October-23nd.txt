Create login form and fetch api in it

To create a login form in React and connect it with an API on the backend to authenticate the user, follow these steps:

1. Backend: Create Login API
We will create a login API on the backend that will check if the user's credentials are correct. If they are, it will return a subsequent authentication requests.

Step 1: Update Backend (server.js)

The POST /login route takes the email and password from the request body.

2. Frontend: Create Login Form in React
In the React frontend, we will create a login form that collects the userâ€™s email and password, sends the data to the backend API, and then handles the response.

Step 1: Create Login.js Component
Step 2: Add Login Component to App.js
